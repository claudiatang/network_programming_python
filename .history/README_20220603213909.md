## Low-level Network Programming in Python
A study repository on network protocol data unit (PDU) implemented in Python3 
### Description
Programs in this repository are written in python3, aiming to dissect the anatomy and investigate the functionalities of protocol data units (PDUs) on different network layers of the TCP/IP network architecture.
For this study purpose, library chosen are limited to python's low-level networking interface and binary data construct/deconstruct libraries, such as socket and struct, while python modules that already provide packet manipulation are not used.

### Contents
Each program provides code and algorithm explanation, please refer to below links for details

### Dependencies 
python3 standard libraries
Please refer to [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for downloading and installing python3.
