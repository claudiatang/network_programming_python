## Low-level Network Programming in Python
A study repository on network protocol data unit (PDU) implemented in Python3 
### Description
Programs in this repository are written in Python3, aiming to dissect the anatomy and investigate the functionalities of protocol data units (PDUs) on different network layers of the TCP/IP network architecture.
For this study purpose, library chosen are limited to Python's low-level networking interface and binary data construct/deconstruct libraries, such as socket and struct, while Python modules that already provide packet manipulation are not used.
### Dependencies 
Python3 standard libraries
