### Command format

&emsp;&emsp;The command format for pinging a remote server is:\
&emsp;&emsp;`python ping.py <hostname>`

### Functions

- #### Calculate checksum

  `def calChecksum(packet)`
  | parameter(s) |type|description|
  |-|-|-|
  |packet|_bytes_|bytes object of header+payload|
  - Checksum calculation uses the common checksum algorithm that is also adopted by many other protocols including IP, UDP and TCP.
  The algorithm adds together every two 16-bit words, and wraps around the final carry to be added to the sum. This is illustrated in the following figure:
  - python bytes object is a sequence of single byte (8 bits) that can be accessed by indexes, so every 2 bytes need to be appended together to form a 16-bit word in checksum calculation.
  This is done by ```word = byte_1*256 + byte_2```, where ```byte_1*256``` appends 8 zeros at the end of byte_1.
  - The function also takes in consideration different [endianness]("https://getkt.com/blog/endianness-little-endian-vs-big-endian/") (byte orders) of different computer systems, which decides the order of which the function appends two bytes. The endianness information is obtained by ```sys.byteorder```


- #### Construct echo request

  `def constructEchoRequest(icmp_type, icmp_code, pid, seq_num, pld_size)`
  | parameter(s) |type|description|
  |-|-|-|
  |icmp_type|_numeric literal:<br>integer_|echo request type = 8|
  |icmp_code|_numeric literal:<br>integer_|echo request code = 0|
  |pid|_int_|current process ID number|
  |seq_num|_int_|sequence number of pings&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
  |pld_size|_numeric literal:<br>integer_|size of payload|
  
  |return(s)|type&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;|description|
  |-|-|-|
  |echo request&nbsp;|_bytes_|echo request packet in bytes format|

  - The construction of echo request message is as per the ICMP format specified in the "Echo Reply Message" section of [RFC 792](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792).
  - ```struct.pack(format, v1, v2, ...)``` ([definition](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack)) is used to pack up passed in fields according to the [format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters) argument. ( Note that the Identifier field takes the binary value of current process id formatted to fit into the size of 2 bytes)
  - Fields need to be packed twice:
  When packed up for the 1st time, value of the checksum field is 0.
  After this 1st pack-up, ```calChecksum``` function is called to calculate the checksum value using the bytes object acquired from the 1st pack-up.
  Then, with the calculated checksum value, all fields are being packed up for the 2nd time to construct the final echo request message datagram
  - The constructed echo request datagram is the return value of this function.
  


- #### Send echo request

  `def sendEchoRequest (ping_socket, echo_req_pkt, remote_ip)`
  | parameter(s) |type|description|
  |-|-|-|
  |ping_socket|_socket_|raw socket for ICMP datagram|
  |echo_req_pkt|_bytes_|constructed echo request bytes object|
  |remote_ip|_string_|remote server IP address|

  |return(s)&emsp;&emsp;|type&ensp;&nbsp;|description|
  |-|-|-|
  |start_time|_float_|time stamp at the point of sending<br>(return -1.0 when failing to send)&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;|

- #### Receive echo reply
  `def rcvEchoReply(default_timeout, start_time, ping_socket, pid)`
  | parameter(s) |type||
  |-|-|-|
  |default_timeout|_numeric literal:<br>integer_|timeout value|
  |start_time|_float_|start time stamp captured at the point of sending|
  |ping_socket|_socket_|raw socket for ICMP datagram|
  |pid|_int_|current process ID number|
