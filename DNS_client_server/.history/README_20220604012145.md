### Run the program

- There are two parts of this program:
  1) a DNS server, and
  2) a DNS client
- To use the DNS query function from the client:
Open two terminals. 
In the first terminal run ```python DNSServer.py``` to launch the DNS server and keep the server on. Once succeeded, the program prints "DNS server is ready ..." on the terminal.
In the second terminal run ```python DNSClient``` to open the DNS client program. Once the client is on, provide host name as instructed to query for its IPv4 and Cname record
