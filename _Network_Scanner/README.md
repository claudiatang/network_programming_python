### Introduction
- This program conducts an introductory study on running another program as sub-process using python's subprocess module.
  This network scan program utilises the [ping.py](https://github.com/claudiatang/network_programming_python/tree/main/_Ping) script from the repository as the sub-process to decide whether a scanned LAN address is reachable or not.
### How to run the script
- The command format of the program is: ```python NetworkScanner.py -n/-network <network_address>```
